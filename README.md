# INFM 603 Group Project

## Background

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is the United States federal agency responsible for scientific and technological achievements in human spaceflight, aeronautics, space science, and space applications. NASA’s Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Engagement Program strives to increase K-12 involvement in NASA projects, enhance higher education, support underrepresented communities, strengthen online education, and boost NASA's contribution to informal education.

Inspired by NASA’s mission and the goals of its STEM Engagement Program, graduate students in the University of Maryland College Park’s College of Information Studies (iSchool) created a proposed website for their INFM 603, Information Technology and Organizational Context, group project.

The group of five graduate students played the role of a hypothetical web development and consulting firm and project team that would be contracted by NASA to create a website related to its STEM Engagement Program. The group of five graduate students were not contracted by NASA, did not create any products for NASA, and did not perform any services for NASA whatsoever.

The proposed website the graduate students created would hypothetically be used to further the goals of the NASA STEM Engagement Program by increasing K-12 involvement in NASA projects, strengthening online education, and boosting NASA’s contribution to informal education.

The proposed website would provide elementary and middle school students with educational information on a variety of STEM topics related to NASA’s Moon to Mars exploration plans. After studying this information, students would be able to demonstrate and measure their understanding of these topics. Specifically, students could answer a set of quiz questions about NASA, including its mission to send the first woman and next man to the Moon by 2024 and preparation to send astronauts to Mars.

## Website

The proposed website consists of three web pages:
1. Home - a page welcoming students before they preceding throughout the site;  
2. Quizzes - a page where student select NASA-related STEM topics they wish demonstrate and measure their understanding; and  
3. About - a page providing information for students, teachers, and parents on the site purpose.   

## Implementation

The website was created to be web browsers agnostic. The website was also created for use on both desktop/laptop computers and hand-held devices and considers the resolution and interactivity of its display. Lastly, the website was created for use on all operating systems.

The website consists of HTML code for site foundation and Bootstrap for site stylings and design. The site also consists of Python code used in the Django web framework to create the Home, Quiz, and About pages. For quiz questions, a SQL data store was used. Python and Django were used to create quizzes based on the user selection of topic(s) and difficulty level.
