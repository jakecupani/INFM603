    <p class="">
      NASA prides itself on creating technological breakthroughs and expanding
      our understanding of various topics of scientific research. However, the agency
      also wants to create resources to deliver to younger audiences and
      educators to learn and build a foundation based in STEM. Increasing the
      involvement and exposure to STEM fields in K-12 environments will enhance
      higher education, strengthen online education, and introduce students to a
      diverse set of skills. We encourage a collaborative effort with students,
      educators, and parents to not only make learning more engaging, but also to
      prepare generations as they pave the way to a new era of innovation.

            For our educators, we want to provide the most engaging tools and
            resources for your students. Keeping your students engaged in a
            learning environment can be challenging, and using technological
            resources for learning can be challenging as well. As the shift to
            online learning is growing more in popularity, we want to create
            tools that are great for learning and tracking progress. We want to
            help you, our educators, pave the way for your students, as they will be
            the main contributors to our the future. And it starts with you. We
            wanted to create resources that make it easy to keep track of student
            progress as well as monitor material and lesson plans.

            To our parents, we understand that online work and exposing your
            children to a different learning environment can be difficult. We
            can make monitoring your student’s learning easy while ensuring that
            they are fully engaged in a non-traditional classroom setting. You
            are able to keep track of their activity online and see them improve
            with the reading material and quizzes. We also allow collaboration
            with teachers for any support you or your child may need.

            To our students, we wish to provide you with new learning styles in
            the STEM field. We’ve compiled ways for you to actively
            interact with the material and test your knowledge with a variety
            of topics in STEM. With support from educators and parents,
            we will make online learning a way that is enjoyable and
            educational.
